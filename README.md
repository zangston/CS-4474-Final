# CS-4474-Final
### By Group 01 - Ben Tyeryar, Nick Teller, Winston Zhang

This repository consists of a Jupyter Notebook (edited on Google Colab) and a CSV dataset obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/xwolf12/malicious-and-benign-websites?resource=download). Our project in particular chose to deal with URL and server data in order to determine if a website was malicious or benign.

Students were asked to load and process data, then to build classifiers. These classifiers would train on a training set, then report their accuracy on a validation set. Students were then asked to analyze the performance of these classifiers and discuss strategies for improving classification accuracy.
